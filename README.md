# amfoss-tasks (Gokul Krishnan G CSE19321)
These are the tasks I was able to complete till now.(11 out of 14)

0. Install Ubuntu 18.04

  Installing ubuntu was way easier than I thought.I downloaded ubuntu 18.04 and created a bootable usb drive for installing. Then it was just a matter of following the on screen instructions and making partitions. I did run into an error though, the installer was not detecting my hard drive. I got round this by changing the SATA operation mode in the bios from RAID to AHCI.

1. Star all the amFOSS repositories

  This was pretty straight forward, just had to follow all the instructions in the mentioned repository. Copy the script into the developer console of the browser and run.
  
2. Programming

  I used python 3 to complete all the questions. I had no prior experience in computer science and I learned python during the first semester of college.
  
6. CLI App using Go

  I went through the resources provided with the task and read about the flags package of Go.
