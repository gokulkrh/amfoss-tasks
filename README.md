These are the tasks I was able to complete till now.(11 out of 14)

0. Install Ubuntu 18.04

  Installing ubuntu was way easier than I thought.I downloaded ubuntu 18.04 and created a bootable usb drive for installing. Then it was just a matter of following the on screen instructions and making partitions. I did run into an error though, the installer was not detecting my hard drive. I got round this by changing the SATA operation mode in the bios from RAID to AHCI.
